        <p>
          Everyday we wake up and live the day we have been given. It is such a grateful thing that we are breathing and the heart is beating, but to some people, it may not be the case. It has been more than 2 years now since I have noticed that something was different inside me. I could not function properly in many ways and I was afraid because I was unfamiliar with my new-self. Everyday was a burden living in the shadows and I thought it might be even better if I could just disappear. I realized I should get consulted and now I know I am going through a mental disorder. Even though it sounds a bit depressing but that is not the only side of it. Because of the illness I was able to think more. Thanks to the melancholic mood, I was able to create some satisfying work. Sometimes it acts as a disrupter but at times it becomes a pilot. In my thesis, I want to explore the correlation between depression(or in a broader sense: mental illness) and creativity with references of studies and some arguments of philosophers in history. By writing this thesis, I want to understand more about myself and make people with/without mental disorder see the positive sides of it and change the perception of depression that we commonly have.

  1.	Prologue

  <p>
    <i>“Nihao.”</i> Another random guy greeted me on the street in a language that I don’t speak, and the guy himself doesn’t seem to speak either. It might be the 58th “Nihao” I have heard living in the Netherlands. I stopped counting so I am not so sure. Sometimes I sense sexual connotation from their eyes and the tone of their voice. Non-asian people ask me if there is any chance that they purely wanted to say hello. Then I ask them again if they greet anyone on the street in a language that you think the person seem to speak. You don’t say “Bonjour.” to a random person who you assume he or she is french only by their look. Outside, I feel uncomfortable and insecure. I want to be invisible. Every morning I hope not to hear any words from anyone I do not know.

  Once I was in Primark with a friend. Kids’ pajamas that seemed to be a collaboration with Disney were on display. I told my friend, “Look! It seems they’ve collaborated with Disney!” Soon I found a random guy stood next to me and asked, “Do you want to buy this?” as if he is willing to buy me one if I want. But at first I didn’t realize. So I asked again with a little smile on my face, “Sorry?” to check if what I just heard was right. He repeated what he said. I heard him just right. Then my friend snatched my hand, told me not to smile
  at him and told him off with anger. I felt like a fool. Why did I have
  to smile?

  On the television, I saw a german advert. Here is how the guardian described the ad.
  <p style="padding-left: 1.5em; width: 50%;">
    <i>“The commercial, produced by the German DIY-store chain Hornbach, shows white men working outside in a garden before removing their sweaty clothing and dumping it in a box. The ad then cuts to a grey, industrial city that resembles Tokyo where an Asian woman buys a bag of dirty clothes – previously worn by the men – opens it and moans with pleasure, as the commercial ends with a slogan saying: “That’s how the spring smells.””</i> 1)

    Immediately I got furious. Am I truly living in the 21st century? I could not believe what I have seen. Do they even know what we have to go through in our daily lives? How can they so easily say it’s a joke? What asian women experience is not a joke. For whatever reasons, some people have wrong and stereotypical image and fantasy on us. They think asian women are weak, easy, funny, and weird. So easily we get victimized based on racial slurs. I was so mad with the advert and put it on my social media to raise my voice. Soon I have got a message from a fellow friend who is not from asia, asking if I could explain why this is racist. I was shocked. I thought this was too obvious but for others it wasn’t. It was not the advert that made me feel lethargic but the fact that this anger I feel cannot be shared had made me feel so different and apart from others who are non-asian. Slowly I had built a wall between me and others. I was alone.

  I stayed home more than ever. I wanted to make as small human interaction as possible. Even just seeing people who look different from me made me insecure and watching birds flying outside the window comforted me more than anyone. There were a lot more incidents happened that made me depressed. If the total amount of tears I have cried in my whole life could be measured as 100, 50 was from the Netherlands. It was not that only the Netherlands was affecting my depression. It was also my parents, my childhood, my ex-boyfriends, my study, my religion, my sexuality, every little thing was dragging me into a deep dump that I cannot come out of. Everything was attacking me in so many angles. Sometimes I cried and I didn’t know why I was crying. I even tried to search it on the internet to figure out why I am crying. It felt so hollow inside my chest. I also had experienced light alcohol dependency. Only after drinking, I could tear down the pressure that I felt on my chest.
</p>


  If all these depressive symptoms were the only thing that I have experienced, I wouldn’t have taken this subject for my thesis. Although it was severely painful and I lost all the energy, due to depression I could think more. As I was thinking, I could question things. Through questioning, I could get to know myself more. By knowing myself more, I questioned myself of what I could do. Then I tried to push myself to do what I have to do. Of course it is not easy. Most of the days, I failed. But when I did make it, it was a small step to get out of the dump that I was tied down. That is what I have experienced. And I want others to know too. I want to tell others who are experiencing melancholia that even though it feels so dark, and could see no light, you might be able to find a dot. Follow the dot, then you see a rope. Climb up the rope. You fall. It’s okay. You can climb again. Make little steps. One day you will see the light. You might fall again into the dump. But now you know you can come out if you try. Knowing that you can already makes huge difference from not knowing. Be creative to find a dot and you will be able to take the next step.

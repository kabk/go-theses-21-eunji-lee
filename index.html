It seems they’ve collaborated with Disney!” Soon I found a random guy stood next to me and asked, “Do you want to buy this?” as if he is willing to buy me one if I want<span class="dot prologue">.</span> But at first I didn’t realize<span class="dot prologue">.</span> So I asked again with a little smile on my face, “Sorry?” to check if what I just heard was right<span class="dot prologue">.</span> He repeated what he said<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I heard him just right<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Then my friend snatched my hand, told me not to smile
                    at him and told him off with anger<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I felt like a fool<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Why did I have

                    On the television, I saw a german advert<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Here is how the guardian described the ad<span class="dot prologue">.</span>

                      Immediately I got furious<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Am I truly living in the 21st century? I could not believe what I have seen. Do they even know what we have to go through in our daily lives? How can they so easily say it’s a joke? What asian women experience is not a joke<span class="dot prologue">.</span> For whatever reasons, some people have wrong and stereotypical image and fantasy on us<span class="dot prologue">.</span> They think asian women are weak, easy, funny, and weird<span class="dot prologue">.</span> So easily we get victimized based on racial slurs<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I was so mad with the advert and put it on my social media to raise my voice<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Soon I have got a message from a fellow friend who is not from asia, asking if I could explain why this is racist<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I was shocked<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I thought this was too obvious but for others it wasn’t<span class="dot prologue">.</span> It was not the advert that made me feel lethargic but the fact that this anger I feel cannot be shared had made me feel so different and apart from others who are non-asian<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Slowly I had built a wall between me and others<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I was alone<span class="dot prologue">.</span>

                  <p>
                    I stayed home more than ever<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I wanted to make as small human interaction as possible<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Even just seeing people who look different from me made me insecure and watching birds flying outside the window comforted me more than anyone<span class="dot prologue">.</span> There were a lot more incidents happened that made me depressed<span class="dot prologue">.</span> If the total amount of tears I have cried in my whole life could be measured as 100, 50 was from the Netherlands<span class="dot prologue">.</span> It was not that only the Netherlands was affecting my depression<span class="dot prologue">.</span> It was also my parents, my childhood, my ex-boyfriends, my study, my religion, my sexuality, every little thing was dragging me into a deep dump that I cannot come out of<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Everything was attacking me in so many angles<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Sometimes I cried and I didn’t know why I was crying<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I even tried to search it on the internet to figure out why I am crying<span class="dot prologue">.</span> It felt so hollow inside my chest<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I also had experienced light alcohol dependency<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Only after drinking, I could tear down the pressure that I felt on my chest<span class="dot prologue">.</span>

                  <p>
                    If all these depressive symptoms were the only thing that I have experienced, I wouldn’t have taken this subject for my thesis<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Although it was severely painful and I lost all the energy, due to depression I could think more<span class="dot prologue">.</span> As I was thinking, I could question things<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Through questioning, I could get to know myself more<span class="dot prologue">.</span> By knowing myself more, I questioned myself of what I could do<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Then I tried to push myself to do what I have to do<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Of course it is not easy<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Most of the days, I failed<span class="dot prologue">.</span> But when I did make it, it was a small step to get out of the dump that I was tied down<span class="dot prologue">.</span> That is what I have experienced<span class="dot prologue">.</span> And I want others to know too<span class="dot prologue">.</span> I want to tell others who are experiencing melancholia that even though it feels so dark, and could see no light, you might be able to find a dot<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Follow the dot, then you see a rope<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Climb up the rope<span class="dot prologue">.</span> You fall<span class="dot prologue">.</span> It’s okay<span class="dot prologue">.</span> You can climb again<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Make little steps<span class="dot prologue">.</span> One day you will see the light<span class="dot prologue">.</span> You might fall again into the dump<span class="dot prologue">.</span> But now you know you can come out if you try<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Knowing that you can already makes huge difference from not knowing<span class="dot prologue">.</span> Be creative to find a dot and you will be able to take the next step<span class="dot prologue">.</span>

                  <p>
                    I wanted to know what this illness is that made me so troubled Of course, no one can assure what is right or wrong Especially with this type of subject that is abstract, it is even harder to determine<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Though it was interesting to see how Aristotle explained the mechanism of black bile inside human body to understand why melancholics behave in certain ways, and how Freud tried to explain melancholia by psychoanalysis Moreover, Kristeva’s innovative view on artwork as a result of therapeutic activity helped me see melancholia in a new way<span class="dot ch2">.</span> To know and understand myself more, I had to face the illness directly So I started from the word itself From the very beginning, the word “melancholy” was a term that was used in Ancient Greek Medicine Etymologically, the word “melancholy” originated from the Acient Greek word melánkholos (μελάγχολος), which is a compound word of mélas(μέλας), meaning “black”, and khólos(χόλος), meaning “bile”<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                  <p>
                  To understand Aristotle’s discourse on melancholia, I should first explain about the theory of Hippocrates’<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In 400 B<span class="dot ch2">.</span>C<span class="dot ch2">.</span>, the Greek physician Hippocrates theorized The Four Humors
                  insisting that the human body consits of four major fluids: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm<span class="dot ch2">.</span> The Greeks believed that these Four Humours should remain balanced in order for people to maintain good health<span class="dot ch2">.</span> A preponderance of black bile would cause a person to become despondent and anxious<span class="dot ch2">.</span> They called this condition melancholia and it became the first term used for depression<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Even though modern medical science has rejected the theories of the four temperaments, it is still very valuable to see how ancient people thought of melancholia<span class="dot ch2">.</span> It is how they imagined the fluctuous hormonic reaction inside the body<span class="dot ch2">.</span>
                  </p>

                  <h3 id="content-Ari" style="margin:1em;">From Aristotle to Freud</h3>

                  <p>
                    In liberal arts, specifically in philosopy, it all started from the great Greek philosopher,
                    Aristotle<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In one of his writings called Problems II, Book XXX (there has been a controversy over its authenticity of whether it is an Aristotlian or pseudo-Aristotlian), he addresses a question about melancholia asking why all men who have become outstanding in philosophy, statesmanship, poetry, or the arts are melancholic<span class="dot ch2">.</span> He was the first man to associate melancholia to philosophy, politics, poetry, and the arts<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Since then, it had been a major topic in philosophy and aesthetics<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Furthermore, Aristotle saw melancholia as a compound of two conflicting nature<span class="dot ch2">.</span> He understood that melancholic humor is a mixture of hot and cold, and it itself is very variable<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Black bile(melancholic humor) can be heated to high degree and turn cold as ice for a flash<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Thus, melancholics are inevitably in erratic and fluctuant state due to their disposition<span class="dot ch2">.</span> The heat inside one's body is the power that moves its mind and soul, and the hot air means some kind of erotic passion<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Erotic passion here is not limited to the realm of sex but can also be interpreted as love<span class="dot ch2">.</span> That passion stimulates senses and it operates imagination to its extreme<span class="dot ch2">.</span> The temperature of black bile has direct effects to one's mind, creating a certain character, and there is great variety in the temperaments of melancholics<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Some could be puzzled because they assumed that melancholics are always in depressive mood, but it is not true<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Also in modern psychiatry, they say there are various types of depression<span class="dot ch2">.</span> It varies in accordance of the duration of highs and lows in emotion<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Perhaps this can be linked to why melancholics do not share identical experience but different case by case<span class="dot ch2">.</span>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Sigmund Freud is an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis who analyzed melancholia pathologically through comparison with mourning<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Mourning and Melancholia is a work of Freud which has influenced numerous philosophers such as Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, Jacques Derrida, Slavoj Zizek, and so many others<span class="dot ch2">.</span> According to his writing, mourning is a "reaction to the loss of a loved person, or to the loss of some abstraction which has taken the place of one, such as one’s country, liberty, an ideal, and so on"<span class="dot ch2">.</span>2 In mourning, it is the world which has become poor and empty; whereas, in melancholia, it is the ego itself<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In melancholia, one cannot consciously percieve what they have lost, but in contrast, there is nothing about the loss that is unconscious when it comes to mourning<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Here I could relate to my own experience of not knowing why I was crying sometimes<span class="dot ch2">.</span> I was feeling depressive but I didn't know what was making me so<span class="dot ch2">.</span> This is why mourning is considered a healthy and natural process that a person goes through when grieving a loss, while melancholia is considered pathological3<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In addition, Freud believed that depression is highly affected by personal history, and he emphasized the role of grief resulting from the loss of an important relationship, triggering earlier memories of loss of, or rejection by, those first objects of love, the parents<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Perhaps this explains why I was kept on having flashbacks of my childhood<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Those include my mom's physical abuse, how my parents had reacted/dealt with my sexuality, and such<span class="dot ch2">.</span>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Furthermore, Freud argued that the ultimate impetus of melancholia is an erotic desire, and the loss of capacity to love due to the loss of a loved object becomes an 'excessive attachment' towards the lost object and leads to melancholia through the identification process of the self and the lost object<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Moreover, Freud points out self-reporaches and self-revilings, and excessive guilt as distinguisihing features of melancholia<span class="dot ch2">.</span> He argues that “self-reproaches are reproaches against a loved object which have been shifted away from it on to the patient’s own ego” and that establish a relation of identification between the melancholic’s ego and the loved object<span class="dot ch2">.</span> I had experienced two breakups in the Netherlands and both left me with questioning if I was the problem, or where I went wrong<span class="dot ch2">.</span> There were moments when I blamed myself or my situation for those breakups, saying maybe I shouldn't have done this and that<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Going over both Aristotle and Freud's theory on melancholia, I was able to reflect on my own experience and understand more about my melancholia<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Still I have some questions left to be answered but at least it was worthy to find out what it was that I went through<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                  <p>
                    As opposed to present-day perception of melancholia, there were times when it was praised and glorified in history<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Aristotle was the first man stating in the 4th century B<span class="dot ch2">.</span>C<span class="dot ch2">.</span>E<span class="dot ch2">.</span> that
                  </p>

                      <i>all men who have attained excellence in philosophy, in poetry, in art and in politics, even Socrates and Plato, had a melancholic habitus; indeed some suffered even from melancholic disease<span class="dot ch2">.</span></i> 
                    </p>

                  <p>
                      During the Renaissance period, this belief had come to its revival and led John Milton to exclaim, in his poem Il Penseroso:

                    However, by the 18th century, the term melancholia gained back its clinical roots and had been considered as madness or as a deadly sin in religious perspective for a long time<span class="dot ch2">.</span> As you can see from the constant flips and reversals on perception of melancholia, it is not the first nor unconventional attempt to bring a change towards the way we perceive the condition<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Melancholia may seem negative and in many aspects, it is indeed, but I wanted to say that it is not only negative but there actually are some potentials of melancholia<span class="dot ch2">.</span> As a person who have experienced it, and still does from time to time, it sometimes makes you think, question, fight, and create<span class="dot ch2">.</span> That is why I wanted to find if there had been some discussions regarding the relation between melancholia and creativity<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Finding out how greek people in acient times had thought of melancholia
                    was somehow comforting<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Not that it says that I am special or anything but that I am not the only one who tried to make a link between melancholia and creativity<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Nevertheless, I have found the right person who has suggested a great insight on melancholia; Julia Kristeva, and the right person who has proved it; Louise Bourgeois<span class="dot ch2">.</span>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Julia Kristeva, born in 1941, is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, psychoanalyst, feminist and she explains melancholia as a source of creation to poets and artists<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In her work Desire in Language (1980), Kristeva describes “the symbolic” as the realm in which a child becomes a “speaking subject,” and develops a sense of identity separate from the mother, distinguishing between self and other<span class="dot ch2">.</span> This process of separation is called abjection, and in order to enter “the symbolic” — the world of language, meaning, culture, and the social which can also be associated with the masculine, the law, and structure
                    —, the child must reject and move away from the mother<span class="dot ch2">.</span> She argues that the perpetual desire for the lost mother, refusing to let go of that first maternal identification, can be a source of great artistic creativity<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In her other work Black Sun (1989), she points out that especially female children continue to simultaneously reject and identify with the mother figure, and that they are more prone to retain a close connection to what she called “the semiotic” — it is similar to the concept of Lacan’s pre-mirror stage, and she refers to this phenomenon as melancholia<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Furthermore, Kristeva associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsis – an impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it<span class="dot ch2">.</span>2) In other words, Kristeva contends that aesthetic elaboration through a work of art can be considered as a therapeutic method to alleviate the pain of melancholia<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Thus, in her view, those creations of melancholic artists are the outcome of a therapeutic process to heal, and that is what Kristeva calls the melancholic “sublime<span class="dot ch2">.</span>” 5

                    Before writing this thesis, I have known Louise Bourgeois only as an artist who made grotesque and sexual work, but during the research I happened to find more about her background stories and therefore I could have a better understanding of her work and could relate to her<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Having known about her stories behind her work, she was the right person as a reference to my subject who can verify Kristeva’s theory<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                  <p>
                    Louise Bourgeois, a French-American artist, was born in 1911 in Paris and her family ran a business of repairing tapestries<span class="dot ch2">.</span> She was very close to her mother Joséphine, but her father Louis, whom she was named after, was a person who gave her traumatic memories<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Her mother went through an illness and for 10 years her father was having an affair with Louise’s English teacher, Sadie, who resided with her family<span class="dot ch2">.</span> As much as she loved her mother, she loathed her father<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Ironically, this horrible traumatic memory was what she got the most inspiration from<span class="dot ch2">.</span> This marked the pivotal trauma that led her to create autobiographical artworks encompassing the subject of family, motherhood, relationships, abandonment, and the body<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                    Maman, a sculpture work that depicts a spider, would be the most well known work of Bourgeois<span class="dot ch2">.</span> It is about, as you could possibly assume from the title, her mother<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Spider resembles her mother in the sense that it weaves its web and that her mother made tapestries<span class="dot ch2">.</span> It also depicts the strength of the mother with metaphors of nurture and protection<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Spiders are known for its sacrificing maternity as they protect eggs at their best, and Bourgeois adopted the form of a spider to glorify the motherhood<span class="dot ch2">.</span> The long and fragile legs of the spider reflect her mother being sick, but paradoxically it maximizes the awe of motherhood<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                    The Destruction of the Father (1974), how dreadful and grave the title is, represents a family dinner table<span class="dot ch2">.</span> It was inspired by her childhood fantasy in which she imagines avenging the paternal domination of the family at mealtimes<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In this work, she dismembered her father, cannibalised him<span class="dot ch2">.</span> It represents the reversed power strugle, depriving authority from her father<span class="dot ch2">.</span> It seems like a punishment she gave to her father for betraying her mother and her family<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                  </h5>

                  <p>
                    Bourgeois considered art in parallel to a form of psychoanalysis, offering privilleged and exclusive access to the unconciousness<span class="dot ch2">.</span> By confronting and countless works of sublimation, Louise was able to heal<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Her own work was a series of self-healing act to exorcise her trauma<span class="dot ch2">.</span>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Similar to Louise, I have witnessed my father’s inappropriate message when I was 18 years old, and since then I have been holding resentments towards him for betraying my mother<span class="dot ch2">.</span> According to Freud and Kristeva, it is a result of my identification to my mother<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Adapting Kristeva’s theory to my own experience in the Netherlands, I partially interpreted the mother figure as my home country and understood my melancholia as the conflict of moving away from Korea, my motherland, to the Netherlands, “the symbolic<span class="dot ch2">.</span>” As a woman, not just woman but asian woman living in the White-centered world, I was abjected<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Living in a world where I become the minoirty — ignoring the fact that I was already the minority in Korea as a woman — in order to endure all those hardships, I had to depend on something, and that was Chrisitianity<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Unfortunately, I was abjected again because of my sexuality<span class="dot ch2">.</span> I have acknowledged that I was bisexual when I was 14 years old<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Since then I have known about my sexuality, but at the Korean church where I fleed to, they told me I have to abandon my sexuality if I want to follow Jesus<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Just like a child growing up, moving away from their mother, I had to enter the new world of language, culture, and structure<span class="dot ch2">.</span> In the way of the process, I have experienced conflicts and that also brought up my childhood memories that I happened to forget for a while<span class="dot ch2">.</span> I have experienced several sexual harrassment when I was only six or seven years old from random people, and having to experience that again, and to be exposed to similar situations in a place where I am not familiar with brought that childhood memories again and kept lingering inside my brain<span class="dot ch2">.</span> So many times I have been a victim of sexual harrasmant<span class="dot ch2">.</span> This year I experienced another from my father’s friend two days before my birthday<span class="dot ch2">.</span> That again pulled me down to a huge dump and took some days for me to
                  come out<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Sometimes I questioned myself if the problem was me, having to experience all those incidents<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Here comes creativity to rescue<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Changing the object to blame from myself to the perpetrators<span class="dot ch2">.</span> Then I gain strengths to fight and it can be further turned into aesthetic elaboration to heal finally<span class="dot ch2">.</span>

                  <p>
                    To sum up, the whole journey of writing this thesis has given me opportunities to understand myself more in various angles and new insight to deal with my mental illness<span class="dot ch2">.</span> I was able to confront what I am going through and discover a way to overcome this darkness<span class="dot ch2">.</span> What a complicated world of psychiatry<span class="dot ch2">.</span> As I was greatly inspired by Julia Kristeva's theory on melancholia and creativity, I want to end this chapter by quoting Kristeva's interview:

                      A: Looking back, the negative influence was tremendous, and just as physical pain, depression is also something that should have treatment<span class="dot ch3">.</span> But I think it is not that there was no positive influence of depression<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Though it wasn't during depression that I see positive effect, but after getting cured, I became thankful to every little thing I experience in my daily life<span class="dot ch3">.</span> I could do things that I couldn't do when I was in depression and I became more sensitive towards them<span class="dot ch3">.</span> My depression was so severe that I thought too much about suicide and I had to be hospitalized<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Maybe because of that I find the shift more dramatic<span class="dot ch3">.</span>

                      B: Later I went back to the states again to learn English for a year, and living alone, I had plenty of time to think<span class="dot ch3">.</span> In a place where I was not comfortable with the language, I had thought about my identity a lot and looked back on my life at a distance<span class="dot ch3">.</span> The change of environment and having nowhere/nobody to depend on while living alone made me feel depressive<span class="dot ch3">.</span> During that period, I had realized that to everything there is an end and that made me nihilistic<span class="dot ch3">.</span> I thought life was meaningless, but on the other side, that taught me to appreciate and feel grateful for each and every day<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Life goes on, time passes anyway<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Life is meaningless but therefore we need to value this moment and spend it meaningfully<span class="dot ch3">.</span>

                      E: How was that possible? How could you turn that negative thinking into a positive thinking?
                    </p>

                    <p class="answer">
                      A: Well, back then it was all negative<span class="dot ch3">.</span> But when looking back even before when I wasn't depressive, I think I didn't know myself that much<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It made me think about things that I put off by way of excuse that I had other things to do, like tasks and assignments<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Thoroughly about myself, I didn't know what I like, what makes me happy, this kind of things I hadn't thought about deeply before<span class="dot ch3">.</span> So that is the positive side of melancholia that I have experienced<span class="dot ch3">.</span>

                    <p>
                      E: What is your impression on melancholia in general? What were the factors to your depression?
                    </p>

                    <p class="answer">
                      S(Suho): My impression on melancholia is that I feel so inadequate<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It is like water right before starting to boil and it shatters away<span class="dot ch3">.</span> You don't see movement so the outside seems serene, but inside exists this anxiety which you have no clue when it will burst<span class="dot ch3">.</span> You can't do anything<span class="dot ch3">.</span> When I think about what made me depressive, it was the fear of living as "myself" and self-hatred<span class="dot ch3">.</span>

                    <p>
                      E: It is with no doubt that melancholia has negative influence for the most part but have you experienced any positive aspects?
                    </p>

                    <p class="answer">
                      S: Personally, I think it's almost impossible to find positive sides of depression when you're going through it<span class="dot ch3">.</span> But when you try to come out of it, I believe there is some positive sides<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Regarding my experience, while striving to come out of depression to live everyday healthily, I have started to learn about new feelings that I didn't know before<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It was like drawing with color pencils on a sheet of black paper<span class="dot ch3">.</span> There were some moments when, from cooking, doing laundries, cleaning, these little everyday routine, I started to realize how precious these feelings that I had forgotten or never had known even are<span class="dot ch3">.</span>

                    <p class="answer">
                    S: I think it depends on how you see the meaning of creativity but in respect of finding unfamiliar feelings and emotions, it might be posible to find correlation between the two<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Plus, as there is a saying that "There are one reason for happiness but hundreds for misery<span class="dot ch3">.</span>", it seems like melancholia appears in so many different faces, and that creates lots of stories<span class="dot ch3">.</span>

                    <p style="margin-top: 2em;">
                    To summarize the three interviews above, I came to a conclusion that melancholia does not generate creativity itself<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It is such a painful state that it is almost imposible to do anything<span class="dot ch3">.</span> In fact, creativity seems to take an important role when trying to overcome the condition<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Creativity does not only mean the ability to make something physical but it can also mean the ability to bring up change in ways of thinking<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It is crucial to shift the way of thinking when overcoming melancholia<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Creativity makes you see things in a different way and that brings you joy from what you used to think as nothing and trivial<span class="dot ch3">.</span> In the prologue, I mentioned that I had built a wall between me and others when I felt that we were different and that my feelings and despair could not be shared<span class="dot ch3">.</span> During that period, I was focusing on how much different I was from others and that was gnawing my inner soul bit by bit<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It was not only them who were bullying me but also I was aggravating the pain myself<span class="dot ch3">.</span> In fact, the next year, I felt the neccessity to change the way I see this issue because I thought I should stop torturing myself<span class="dot ch3">.</span> To overcome that feeling of alienation, I made a work about race, suggesting that we should embrace the fact that we are different and learn from each other<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It seems like I was asking others to see things differently but actually it was me who I was talking to, and asking for a change<span class="dot ch3">.</span> For this thesis as well, I felt a lot of times that It was actually me the one that wanted to change and heal from the past, the pain, and the illness<span class="dot ch3">.</span> There were moments that I wanted to avoid confronting, and ran away, but then I talked to myself that I have to do this in order to move on and that I knew I can do this<span class="dot ch3">.</span> I was in extreme darkness at some point, feeling so insecure and the stress was putting me into the dump again<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Again there I saw a lighting dot, telling me that I was only scared of something that doesn't even exist<span class="dot ch3">.</span> That is what I call creativity<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It seems trivial but it was my guardian<span class="dot ch3">.</span> It was a power that guided me through a tunnel of darkness<span class="dot ch3">.</span> Thus, confirming Kristeva's theory, creativity was dragging me out of the darkness<span class="dot ch3">.</span>

                          According to World Health Organization(WHO), depression is the fourth leading cause of disability in the world and by 2025, it will rank the second after obesity-and-diabetes-related disorders<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> Moreover, Robert Sapolsky, an American neuroendocrinologist and professor at Stanford University, said in his lecture in 2009 that “depression is incredibly pervasive and thus important to talk about<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span>” 9 Until 2<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span>5 years ago, I had never imagined that I could experience any kind of depression in my life<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> I had always been a positive girl who stands tall but living in different environment and situations away from my original life in Korea had changed me a lot in many ways<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> School had changed me, the Netherlands had changed me, all those incidents I had to go through had changed me<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> Taking myself as a reference, I am saying that depression or any kind of mental disorder is not something that only few people experience<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> You can never be sure that your close friends or family, or even yourself could be an exception<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> You never know what is ahead of you in your life<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> As in Lars von Trier’s film Melancholia (2011), you could be Justine when you thought you were Claire when the end of the world comes<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> Of course that is not happening (or is it?) and I am not trying to say that I hope you go through such struggles<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> The three interviewees from chapter 3 are those who I had never thought they could experience depression but they told me they have seen some psychiatrists and been taking medicines<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> I was again surprised to see people who did not seem to have any problems have their own struggles and that melancholia is not something so uncommon in our daily lives<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> Therefore we should have a better understanding of melancholia and change our perception on it<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> I hope people who are in the plain of light could help those who are in that of shadow<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> At least by having an amicable perception and a better understanding of melancholia would help those who are undergoing the condition to come out of the darkness<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> We all know light and shadow are inseperable<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> Or if you are melancholic and feel like being alone, turn your creativity to a beacon to bring you out of the darkness<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span> Melancholic inspiration will be in your guidance<span class="dot Epilogue">.</span>

              5) “Sublimation’s dynamics, by summoning up primary processes and idealization, weaves a hypersign around and with the depressive void. This is allegory, as lavishness of that which no longer is, but which regains for myself a higher meaning because I am able to remake nothingness, better than it was and within an unchanging harmony, here and now and forever, for the sake of someone else. Artifice, as sublime meaning for and on behalf of the underlying, implicit nonbeing, replaces the ephemeral. Beauty is consubstantial with it. Like feminine finery concealing stubborn depressions, beauty emerges as the admirable face of loss, transforming it in order to make it live […]. Sublimation alone withstands death. The beautiful object that can bewitch us into its world seems to us more worthy of adoption than any loved or hated cause for wound or sorrow. Depression recognizes this and agrees to live within and for that object, but such adoption of the sublime is no longer libidinal. It is already detached, dissociated, it has already integrated the traces of death, which is signified as lack of concern, absentmindedness, carelessness. Beauty is an artifice; it is imaginary.”
